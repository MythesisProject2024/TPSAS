## Description

This repository includes the Python code for my Stream Application Scheduling approach.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- You need to download a new version of a Python IDE or Pyzo IDE.
- Required libraries: pandas, networkx, mealpy, etc.
- Use the command `pip` to install any necessary library from the internet. 
  Example: `pip install mealpy`

### OS Version

## How to Run the Program

1. Decompress the folder containing all programs and files.
2. Open the Python file: `GSA_Mealpy_githubversion.py`.

### Calculating the Fitness of Each Type of DAG

1. Import the appropriate dataset.
   Example: `import readClusteredDAGfile300`
2. Initialize the list of clustered DAGs.
   Example: `DAG_List_clustred = readClusteredDAGfile300.DAG_List_clustred`
3. Update the population variable.
   Example: `problem_size = 300  # Dimension: number of tasks`

## Output and Results

After running the program, the results are saved in an Excel file named `results.xls`.
